## Task
Everyone should be able to enjoy the power of movement in environments that feel welcoming and comfortable â€“ regardless of your size, gender, ability status, shape, age, or ethnicity. Unfortunately, this does not reflect the fitness experience of many.

As the digital fitness industry grows, how can we use technology to create inclusive and accessible fitness environments where everyone feels seen, empowered and celebrated?
